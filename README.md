# Esports - A Growing Industry

Although the commonly held perception of video games is that it is a waste of teenagers lives and a distraction from the 'real' world, a refuge for the socially inept
I have recently been fascinated with a growing competitive scene and the grow of viewership and along with that sponsors. Many of us have a t some point argued with our parents about the validity and relevance of the hours we have poured into our favourite games.

# Basic usage

## Early days of 'becoming' Professional

_Initially to be a 'pro gamer' you would have had to be amonst the top 1 or 2 players in your chosen game, as intial prize pools were minimal amounts with those placing at the top getting maybe up to £10,000. Certainly not a small amount but with uncertainty around your
future and competitions infrequent to have considered buying a house or supporting a family seemed like a remote prospect, and that is assuming you were the number 1 player in your competition as the drop-off in prize-pools was severe with 2nd receiving a much lower amoun
potentially only having a minimal payout to 3rd; anyone placed below this would likely have a ‘prize’ amounting to nothing, especially if you had travelled to another city or country for your chance to compete. Thankfully these humble beginnings are starting to become a thing
of the past.

## Modern Day Professionals

Professional gamers, or "pro gamers", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like FaZe Clan, 100 Thieves, Evil Geniuses, Team SoloMid, Cloud9, consist of several professionals. These teams often cover multiple esports games within
tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games (Tekken or Street fighter) or sponsor card game players like Hearthstone. In addition to prize money from tournament wins,
players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware, but the players also stand to increase their notoriety by expanding the reach of their name to the fans of any orgs they
may join. Prominent esports sponsors include companies like Logitech and Razer both of which produce computer products. Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, the biggest teams and players have social media followings of over a million.
The move towards more consistent matches and ‘franchising’ particularly in America has aided this as players can be signed and have contractual negotiations, providing the job security to young pros who have in the past been susceptible to manipulation and exploitation.

Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, Jeremy Lin's ownership of Team VGJ, and Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG Esports. Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany, Paris Saint-Germain esports in France; Besiktas JK, Fenerbahce S.K.,
and Galatasaray in Turkey; either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams. 
While different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid, a professional League of Legends team, practice for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more. In April 2020, researchers from the
Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes. This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Players are generally in competition by their
mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s.



## Prize Pools and Rising Competition
Due to the nature of games much of the initial practice and competition can occur online, allowing the best players from around the world to compete with each there at any hour of the day and allowing the best from England or France to compete against other skilled players from Russia
Germany. However due to the advantage of better connection this is usually locked with 'regions' so those living in Europe only competing with others in Europe to try and maintain as level a playing field as possible. However due to the ease with which it is possible to cheat and use
3rd party software to gain an advantage the final stages of competition is usually held on a local network at a specified arena or location this also prevents the possibility that poor connection or worse equipment influencing the outcome of a tournament as the organisers can set up
identical equipment. Often this is provided by a sponsor eager to market their products to the fans of an organisation, player or game and increase their sales.
