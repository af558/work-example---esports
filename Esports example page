# From Video games to Esports

Although the commonly held perception of video games is that it is a waste of teenagers lives and a distraction from the 'real' world, a refuge for the socially inept
I have recently been fascinated with a growing competitive scene and the grow of viewership and along with that sponsors. Many of us have a t some point argued with our parents about the validity and relevance of the hours we have poured into our favourite games.
## Inception of Esports
A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy
games became overwhelmingly popular in internet cafés, particularly in Asia and Korea especially having dedicated Starcraft 2 tournaments, having crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, amongst the 
most popular games as of the early 2022 are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch. Each of which have their own respective dedicated fanbases although there is some 
cross-over. With such huge audiences and the potential to market and control a new form of entertainment esports is backed to be one of the fastest growing industries.

# Basic usage

## Ealry days of 'becoming' Professional

Initially to be a 'pro gamer' you would have had to be amonst the top 1 or 2 players in your chosen game, as intial prize pools were minimal amounts with those placing at the top getting maybe up to £10,000. Certainly not a small amount but with uncertainty around your
future and competitions infrequent to have considered buying a house or supporting a family seemed like a remote prospect, and that is assuming you were the number 1 player in your competition as the drop-off in prize-pools was severe with 2nd receiving a much lower amoun
potentially only having a minimal payout to 3rd; anyone placed below this would likely have a payout amounting to nothing, especially if you had travelled to another city or country for your chance to compete. Thankfully these humble beginnings are starting to become a thing
of the past. 

##  Modern Day Professionals
Professional gamers, or "pro gamers", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like FaZe Clan, 100 Thieves, Evil Geniuses, Team SoloMid, Cloud9, consist of several professionals. These teams often cover multiple esports games within
tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games (Tekken or Street fighter) or sponsor card game players like Hearthstone. In addition to prize money from tournament wins,
players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware, but the players also stand to increase their notoriety by expanding the reach of their name to the fans of any orgs they
may join. Prominent esports sponsors include companies like Logitech and Razer both of which produce computer products. Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, the biggest teams and players have social media followings of over a million.
The move towards more consistent matches and ‘franchising’ particularly in America has aided this as players can be signed and have contractual negotiations, providing the job security to young pros who have in the past been susceptible to manipulation and exploitation.
Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, Jeremy Lin's ownership of Team VGJ, and Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG Esports. Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany, Paris Saint-Germain esports in France; Besiktas JK, Fenerbahce S.K.,
and Galatasaray in Turkey; either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams. 
While different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid, a professional League of Legends team, practice for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more. In April 2020, researchers from the
Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes. This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Players are generally in competition by their
mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s.

## Map

The opposing theatre troupes within London were often in competition with each other, and so productions and the source material was jealously guarded with the popular productions being particularly in demand. This meant that skilled playwrights, who were often actors first, could ensure the fortune and success of their fellow performers. Indeed many productions ere written with the active troupe member refernced as their character in the initial 'scripts' or the characters name is replaced almost synonymously.

## Shakespearean Theatre 
 The King's Men is the acting company to which William Shakespeare (1564–1616) belonged for most of his career. Formerly known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, they became the King's Men in 1603 when King James I ascended the throne and became the company's patron.
